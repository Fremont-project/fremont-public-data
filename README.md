# Fremont Example Dataset
Processed public data for Fremont. This repository serves as an example data source to run the open-source Aimsun microsimulation codebase at [traffic-microsimulation](https://github.com/Fremont-project/traffic-microsimulation).

## Structure
- `aimsun`: Folder that contains all Aimsun input and output data. The input is provided, and the output can be created by running our microsimulation codebase.
- `fremont_example_network.ang`: Aimsun network file for Fremont. This network contains the Fremont road network, as well as pre-populated Master Control Plans.
